Missing Utils
**************************************************************************************
Utils.h and Utils.cpp have been removed in-order for their code to be recycled at
University; the reason of their removal is at the risk of self-plagiarism. You can
contact me at limpygnome@gmail.com if you need help replicating any referenced
functions.
